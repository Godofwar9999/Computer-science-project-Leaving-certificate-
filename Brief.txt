Date: 1st of December - 19th of March
Theme: Forests
Main project: Build functional embedded system that collects environmental data and simulates a real-world process related to the theme of forests. Also develop computer-based model that uses data to test "what-if" scenarios. Make feedback system to adapt as well.


Basic requirements:

1) Embedded system design:
	i) Build functional system that uses (at least) one digital and one analogue input
	ii) System must generate (at least) one output(analogue or digital)
	iii) System can be started or calibrated manually BUT should operate automatically

2) Data collection:
	i) Use system to collect and store data related to theme. (Data will be used in advanced requirements)

3)Process simulation:
	i) Configure system to simulate real-world process related to theme
	ii) Run test to see how system responds using data


Advanced requirements:

1) Disaster risk modelling:
	i) Using Python, develop model of chosen disaster risk related to FORESTS
	ii) Model must use some data collect from system (and can be combined with data from other sources)

2) What-if simulations:
	i) Explore how you risk model behaves under different conditions. Each scenario should change one or more key variables and observe resulting change.

3) Adaptive system:
	i) Extend system to include feedback mechanism (algorithm that adapts over time) that enables it to automatically adapt to changing conditions.
